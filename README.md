# Decentralized_FL

This project is under development currently. This project aims to build a blockchain-based decentralized federated learning system. The blockchain will be used to store the reputation of each node. New federated learning processes can allow nodes with high reputation scores to participate while rejecting nodes with low reputation scores. This will force nodes to act honestly and avoid malicious behaviors.
